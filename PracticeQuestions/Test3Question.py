'''
Write a iterable PyramidIterable(string) that when iterated returns the 1st letter of the input string, 
then the first 2, then the first 3, all the way until it returns the whole word.
You will probably need to make some sort of iterator before making your iterable.
The default value for string should be 'hello world!'. 
If you need to create any attributes make sure they are protected/private/public as appropriate, and justiy your choice. 

Ex: PyramidIterable('cow') should return 'c', 'co', 'cow' then stop iterating. 

Ex: PyramidIterable() should return 'h', 'he', 'hel', 'hell', 'hello', 'hello ', 'hello w', ...
